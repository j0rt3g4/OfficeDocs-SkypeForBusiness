# Support remote workers using Microsoft Teams

Use the best practices in this article to support your users who work remotely or from home.

## Technical

1.  Make sure [Teams is turned on for everyone](assign-teams-licenses.md)
    
      - Look at the [Teams E1 Trial](e1-trial-license.md), [Teams Exploratory](teams-exploratory.md), or [Teams free](https://support.office.com/article/Welcome-to-Microsoft-Teams-free-6d79a648-6913-4696-9237-ed13de64ae3c) to make Teams available to everybody in your company.

      - Remote employees rely more heavily on meetings and audio conferencing. If you haven't yet rolled out these workloads, check out [Meetings and conferencing in Teams](deploy-meetings-microsoft-teams-landing-page.md).

2.  Tell your users about Teams. Download the [Teams Customer Success Kit](https://download.microsoft.com/download/A/E/9/AE984CD4-CF4B-41E7-9ABD-6735E3F01897/MicrosoftTeamsCustomerSuccessKit.zip) to get presentations, sample emails, posters, and getting-started guides.


5.  Make sure your employees have adequate internet access and bandwidth for Teams. Use the guidance in [Prepare your organization's network for Teams](prepare-network.md) to learn how to do this.
    - Limited bandwidth can affect audio quality in Teams meetings. To ensure the best meeting experience under low-bandwidth conditions, encourage users to limit video and use PSTN for calls and meeting audio. 

    - If you need help troubleshooting or fixing problems with call or meeting quality, follow the guidance in [Known issue: Dialing into Skype for Business/Teams conference IDs](#known-issue-dialing-into-skype-for-business-or-teams-conference-ids) at the bottom of this article.

2.  [Send out links to training](enduser-training.md) to help your employees get the most out of Teams.
    
3. Read our new content about working remotely and share it with your users:

3.  Encourage everyone to [install](get-clients.md#mobile-clients) and use the mobile app: [iOS](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=835758)   [Android](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2102168)

4.  Staff up your [helpdesk](troubleshoot-installation.md) to deal with user inquiries.


## Communications

Use Teams to stay in touch with your employees:
- [Org-wide teams](create-an-org-wide-team.md) and [Company Communicator](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/samples/app-templates#company-communicator) app template
    
- Send out information about your org’s work-from-home and health and safety policies.
    
- Use [Live events](teams-live-events/what-are-teams-live-events.md) for company-wide meetings and outreach. For any meeting of more than 250 participants, make it a live event. 

## Personal considerations

Here are some tips for successfully working from home:

- Have a defined physical work space with good lighting and proper ergonomics.

- Set clear boundaries on your work hours and commitments, and use the Teams [presence status](https://support.office.com/article/change-your-status-in-teams-ce36ed14-6bc9-4775-a33e-6629ba4ff78e) to indicate when you're away.

- “Commute” to and from your work-from-home office deliberately; don’t turn work-from-home into home-equals-work.

- Get up and take a break periodically. Go for a walk, stretch, make yourself a cup of tea.

## Known issue: Dialing into Skype for Business or Teams conference IDs

The following is a summary of a Feb 7, 2020 Message center post (MC203397):

Microsoft is aware that some users in the China region are experiencing issues dialing into Skype for Business or Teams conference IDs. In most cases, these problems are external to systems under our control. Often, the issue is with local mobile and telephony carriers. 

We recommend the following if you're having audio conferencing problems:

- Ask the caller or meeting organizer to call your PSTN or mobile number
- Join the call or meeting from the desktop or mobile clients, using VoIP

If you need to log a support ticket, please include the following:
	
- Exact time of call
- Conference bridge number dialed
- Caller phone network
- Caller Phone Number

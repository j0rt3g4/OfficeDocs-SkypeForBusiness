# Microsoft Teams PSTN usage report

The Teams PSTN usage report in the Microsoft Teams admin center gives you an overview of calling and audio conferencing activity in your organization. You can view detailed calling activity for Calling Plans if you use Microsoft as your telephony carrier and for Direct Routing if you use your own telephony carrier.

The **Calling Plans** tab shows information including the number of minutes that users spent in inbound and outbound PSTN calls and the cost of these calls. The **Direct Routing** tab shows you information including the SIP address and call start and end times. Use the information in this report to gain insight into PSTN usage in your organization and help you to investigate, plan, and make business decisions.

## View the report

1. In the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams admin center, click **Analytics & reports** > **Usage reports**. On the **View reports** tab, under **Report**, select **PSTN usage report**.
2. Under **Date range**, select a predefined range of 7 or 28 days, or set a custom range, and then select **Run report**.

## Interpret the report

**Caller/Callee fields considerations**

Depending on the call direction, the Caller or Callee names can contain non-E164 numbers.

These fields can come from the customer SBC(s). There are three formats that the SBC can send to Direct Routing: E.164 numbers, non-E.164 numbers, and strings.

- E.164 phone number from a user who has an E.164 number to a user who also has an E.164 number. 
- Call from a non-E.164 number. A user from a third-party PBX interconnected with Direct Routing makes a call to a Teams user. In this case, the caller number might be any non-E.164 number, for example +1001. 
- A spammer calls and doesn’t present a number, only a name, for example “Internal Revenue Service”. This string will be shown in the reports.

**About Shared Correlation ID**

The Shared Correlation ID only exists in the exported Excel file that you download and indicates that two or more calls are related. 
The following explains the different scenarios, and when Shared Correlation ID is present.

1.	PSTN User 1 on a PSTN endpoint called Teams User 1 on Teams client, call type Dr_In, correlation ID	57f28917-42k5-4c0c-9433-79734873f2ac, no shared correlation ID.
2.	Teams User 1 on Teams client called PSTN User 1 on a PSTN endpoint, call type	Dr_Out	2c12b8ca-62eb-4c48-b68d-e451f518ff4, no shared correlation ID.
3.	PSTN User 1 on a PSTN endpoint called a Teams User 2 on Teams client, call type	Dr_In	f45e9a25-9f94-46e7-a457-84f5940efde9, shared correlation ID f45e9a25-9f94-46e7-a457-84f5940efde9.
4.	Existing call 3 with correlation ID “f45e9a25-9f94-46e7-a457-84f5940efde9”. PSTN User 1 in a call with Teams User 2. Teams User 2 transferred (blind or consultative) a call to Teams or PSTN User, call type	Dr_Out_User_Transfer	45a1da7c-9e97-481a-8a05-3fe19a9a77e0, shared correlation ID	f45e9a25-9f94-46e7-a457-84f5940efde9.
